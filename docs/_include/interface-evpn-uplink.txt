.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces {{ var0 }} <interface> evpn uplink

  When all the underlay links go down the PE no longer has access
  to the VxLAN +overlay. To prevent blackholing of traffic the
  server/ES links are protodowned on the PE.

  A link can be setup for uplink tracking via the following example:

  .. code-block:: none

    set interfaces {{ var0 }} {{ var1 }} evpn uplink
